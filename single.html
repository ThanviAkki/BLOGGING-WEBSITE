    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
        Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
        <br>
        <b>How does machine learning work?</b><br>
        UC Berkeley (link resides outside ibm.com) breaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts.
        <br>
        A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.
        <br>An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.
        <br>A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Data Science</h2>
    <p>
        Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.

<br>The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the fastest growing field across every industry. As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed the “sexiest job of the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review (link resides outside ibm.com). Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes.

<br>The data science lifecycle involves various roles, tools, and processes, which enables analysts to glean actionable insights. Typically, a data science project undergoes the following stages:

<br>Data ingestion: The lifecycle begins with the data collection—both raw structured and unstructured data from all relevant sources using a variety of methods. These methods can include manual entry, web scraping, and real-time streaming data from systems and devices. Data sources can include structured data, such as customer data, along with unstructured data like log files, video, audio, pictures, the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, and more.
<br>Data storage and data processing: Since data can have different formats and structures, companies need to consider different storage systems based on the type of data that needs to be captured. Data management teams help to set standards around data storage and structure, which facilitate workflows around analytics, machine learning and deep learning models. This stage includes cleaning data, deduplicating, transforming and combining the data using ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs or other data integration technologies. This data preparation is essential for promoting data quality before loading into a data warehouse, data lake, or other repository.
<br>Data analysis: Here, data scientists conduct an exploratory data analysis to examine biases, patterns, ranges, and distributions of values within the data. This data analytics exploration drives hypothesis generation for a/b testing. It also allows analysts to determine the data’s relevance for use within modeling efforts for predictive analytics, machine learning, and/or deep learning. Depending on a model’s accuracy, organizations can become reliant on these insights for business decision making, allowing them to drive more scalability.
<br>Communicate: Finally, insights are presented as reports and other data visualizations that make the insights—and their impact on business—easier for business analysts and other decision-makers to understand. A data science programming language such as R or Python includes components for generating visualizations; alternately, data scientists can use dedicated visualization tools.

    <h2>3-D Modelling</h2>
    <p>
        3D modelling is the process of creating 3D objects using specialised software. These models can be staged with other visual effects to create entire scenes for still imagery or animation. Anybody can get started in 3D modelling with the right tools.
        <br>
        <b>What is 3D modeling used for?</b><br>
3D models are used in film, gaming, architecture, product design, and more. While you may expect to see 3D models in entertainment industries and virtual reality, you might be surprised to realize 3D models are used in many more industries.
<br>
<b>Where we see 3D modelling today:</b><br>
Here are some common 3D modelling examples. Keep in mind, sometimes these models are so life-like, it can be hard to realise you’re seeing a rendered image in the first place.

 
<br>
1. Entertainment and media: 3D modelling is used extensively in VFX, video games and films and TV. It isn’t at all uncommon to see productions that are entirely created using 3D software.
<br>
 

2. Architecture and real estate: Architects and designers utilise 3D modelling to create detailed virtual representations of buildings, interiors and landscapes. These models are very useful in communicating the designer’s vision to prospective investors, clients and the public.
<br>
 

3. Product design and manufacturing: 3D modelling is an efficient and environmental-friendly way to develop prototypes, visualise product ideas and simulate functionality pre-production. Designers can refine ideas and make countless iterations before a product is finalised.
<br>
 

4. Automotive and aerospace industries: 3D modelling is used in both the design and testing of vehicles and their components and in the advertising and marketing of them. Many commercials of cars and airliners feature 3D generated imagery that looks so realistic it’s nearly impossible to tell they aren’t real camera footage. 3D allows for realistic simulations, which can be used in testing an idea or vehicle before it’s built.
<br>
 

5. Medical and healthcare: 3D modelling is utilised in medical imaging and surgical planning. Accurate recreations of organs, bones and tissues can be used to aid in diagnosis, treatment planning and aid medical research.
<br>
 

6. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR): 3D modelling is essential in creating immersive experiences. VR and AR have several applications and can be used across nearly any industry.
<br>
 

7. Education and training: 3D modelling is used in educational settings to teach concepts in a variety of subjects, from biology, to geography and even history. It allows students and professionals to interact with virtual models and simulations in safe, controlled environments. A great example of this is pilots flying in a flight simulator.

    <h2>Animation</h2>
    <p>
        Animation is a filmmaking technique by which still images are manipulated to create moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets (cels) to be photographed and exhibited on film. Animation has been recognized as an artistic medium, specifically within the entertainment industry. Many animations are computer animations made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Stop motion animation, in particular claymation, has continued to exist alongside these other forms.
<br>
Animation is contrasted with live-action film, although the two do not exist in isolation. Many moviemakers have produced films that are a hybrid of the two. As CGI increasingly approximates photographic imagery, filmmakers can easily composite 3D animations into their film rather than using practical effects for showy visual effects (VFX).

    <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
    <p>
        Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data.
<br>
Software developers require slightly different skills, tools, and software knowledge for frontend and backend development. However, full-stack development combines both disciplines—meaning teams can build applications from start to finish in an integrated and cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application that encompasses both frontend and backend in a single code base. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Artifcial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence, or AI, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.
<br>
On its own or combined with other technologies (e.g., sensors, geolocation, robotics) AI can perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence or intervention. Digital assistants, GPS guidance, autonomous vehicles, and generative AI tools (like Open AI's Chat GPT) are just a few examples of AI in the daily news and our daily lives.
<br>
As a field of computer science, artificial intelligence encompasses (and is often mentioned together with) machine learning and deep learning. These disciplines involve the development of AI algorithms, modeled after the decision-making processes of the human brain, that can ‘learn’ from available data and make increasingly more accurate classifications or predictions over time.
